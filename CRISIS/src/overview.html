	<h1>About the CRISIS Project</h1>

	<p>The models and tools used by central banks, finance ministries,
		and regulators today generally rely on three strong assumptions: 1)
		that households, firms, and governments are perfectly rational and are
		homogeneous in their behaviors, 2) that markets always clear and the
		economy settles into a balanced equilibrium state, and 3) that the
		detailed institutional structures and interconnections of the
		financial system, i.e. the 'plumbing' of the system, does not
		generally matter for macro policy.</p>

	<p>While models relying on these assumptions may provide 'good
		enough' answers during normal times, during the crisis they proved
		highly inadequate. The crisis was characterized by behaviors that did
		not fit the 'perfectly rational' models, markets that failed to clear,
		severe economic imbalances that were far from equilibrium, and micro
		level features of the system and network structures of interconnection
		between institutions had major systemic impacts.</p>

	<p>The CRISIS project will seek to address these limitations by
		building a next generation macroeconomic and financial system
		policymaking model. The CRISIS model will be a bottom-up 'agent-based'
		simulation that fully accounts for the heterogeneity of households,
		firms, and government actors. The model will incorporate the latest
		evidence from behavioral economics in portraying agent behavior, and
		the CRISIS team will also collect new data on agent decision making
		using experimental economics techniques. While any model must make
		simplifying assumptions about human behavior, the CRISIS model will be
		significantly more realistic in its portrayal of relevant agent
		behavior than the current generation of policymaking models.</p>

	<p>Using an agent-based approach, the CRISIS model will not be
		constrained to market clearing, equilibrium behaviors. It will be able
		to realistically model market dysfunction and non-equilibrium
		dynamics. Critical features of the crisis included self-amplifying
		feedback from herd behavior, and cascades of contagion spreading from
		one asset class and geography to another. These behaviors are
		difficult to model with traditional linear, equilibrium based
		approaches, but will be captured by the CRISIS model.</p>

	<p>CRISIS will also explicitly model the network and institutional
		structure of the financial system and its interconnections to the
		larger macro economy. As the collapse of Lehman Brothers showed, some
		institutions are 'too connected to fail' and the system's micro level
		structure can have macro level consequences. Recent work by academics
		and central banks has further shown the importance of incorporating
		network structure in our understanding of systemic risk.</p>

	<p>The CRISIS project will be unique in not just producing an
		agent-based model that captures stylized behaviors of the
		macroeconomic-financial system, but will parameterize and test the
		model with empirical data. A major part of the project will involve
		the construction of key micro and macro databases for model
		calibration and validation. CRISIS will initially focus on data for
		the EU financial system and macro economy, but the model will be
		extendable to other regions and eventually the global system.</p>

	<p>CRISIS will also seek to be state of the art in usability and
		transparency for policy decision makers. Another limitation of current
		tools is that they are often a 'black box' with little transparency
		and are difficult to work with. Agent-based models have an intuitive,
		transparent structure â€“ the CRISIS model will explicitly show the
		behavior of individual households, financial institutions, firms, and
		government entities, and the relationships and feedbacks between them.
		The CRISIS model will also have a gaming interface to allow decision
		makers and other stakeholders to directly interact with the model, and
		leading edge visualization and scenario analysis tools.</p>
