@article{Prachowny93,
	Abstract = {Okun's Law has been accepted as an empirical regularity that predicts a 3 percentage point increase in output for every 1 point reduction in the unemployment rate, but only because other facts, such as weekly hours, induced labor supply and productivity tend to rise as well. When output gaps are estimated for the U.S. economy with a production-function approach, using two different data sets for potential output and NAIRU, it is found that the marginal contribution of a 1 point reduction in unemployment is only about two-thirds percent increase in output. Changes in weekly hours and capacity utilization have independent effects on the output gap. Copyright 1993 by MIT Press.},

@article{Axtell01,
	Abstract = {Analyses of firm sizes have historically used data that included limited samples of small firms, data typically described by lognormal distributions. Using data on the entire population of tax-paying firms in the United States, I show here that the Zipf distribution characterizes firm sizes: the probability a firm is larger than sizes is inversely proportional to s. These results hold for data from multiple years and for various definitions of firm size.},

@article{Orphanides03,
	Abstract = {This study examines the usefulness of the Taylor-rule framework as an organizing device for describing the policy debate and evolution of monetary policy in the United States. Monetary policy during the 1920s and since the 1951 Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord can be broadly interpreted in terms of this framework with rather surprising consistency. In broad terms, during these periods policy has been generally formulated in a forward-looking manner with price stability and economic stability serving as implicit or explicit guides. As early as the 1920s, measures of real economic activity relative to \&quot;normal\&quot; or \&quot;potential\&quot; supply appear to have influenced policy analysis and deliberations. Confidence in such measures as guides for activist monetary policy proved counterproductive at times, resulting in excessive activism, such as during the Great Inflation and at the brink of the Great Depression. Policy during the past two decades is broadly consistent with natural-growth targeting variants of the Taylor rule that exhibit less activism.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},
